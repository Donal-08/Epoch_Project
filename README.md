# OpenAI Gym's Taxi-v3 Task
## Solving the Taxi Problem from OpenAI Gym using Q-Learning
This project was developed by Donal Loitam, Club member of Epoch (2022-2023). <br/>
The goal is to use OpenAI Gym's Taxi-v3 environment and implement an algorithm to teach a taxi agent to navigate a small (5x5)gridworld. <br/>
The environment map looks something like this: <br/>
          +---------+  <br/>
          |R: | : :G|  <br/>
          | : | : : |  <br/>
          | : : : : |  <br/>
          | | : | : |  <br/>
          |Y| : |B: |  <br/>
          +---------+  <br/>
