# OpenAI Gym's Taxi-v3 Task
## Solving the Taxi Problem from OpenAI Gym using Q-Learning
This project was developed by Donal Loitam, Club member of Epoch (2022-2023).
The goal is to use OpenAI Gym's Taxi-v3 environment and implement an algorithm to teach a taxi agent to navigate a small (5x5)gridworld.
The environment map looks something like this:
          +---------+
          |R: | : :G|
          | : | : : |
          | : : : : |
          | | : | : |
          |Y| : |B: |
          +---------+
